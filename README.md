Food Delivery Profitability Analysis
Project Description:
This project aims to provide a comprehensive profitability  analysis for a food delivery business based in New Delhi, using transaction data from orders, deliveries, and commissions. The analysis offers strategic insights into how different factors, such as discounts, delivery fees, and commission rates, impact the overall revenue and profit. Through the application of multiple scenarios, we simulate various strategies to optimize profits while maintaining a balance between customer satisfaction and business performance.

Key components of the project include:

Initial Profitability Assessment:

Calculate and visualize the overall revenue and profit for the business, based on order values, discounts, commissions, and other operational costs.

Scenario Simulations:

Discount Reduction Simulation: Explore the impact of reducing customer discounts by 20% on revenue and profit margins.

Delivery Fee Increase: Simulate the effect of increasing delivery fees by ₹20 per order on the overall financial performance.

Commission Optimization:

Identify the breakeven commission increase—the ideal commission rate that maximizes profit without significantly affecting customer retention or satisfaction.

Segment-wise Profit Analysis:

Break down profits by key segments such as payment method and restaurant ID to identify high-performing categories and opportunities for targeted improvements.

Time-Based Analysis:

Conduct a month-over-month profit analysis to observe trends and fluctuations in profits, helping to identify seasonal patterns or the effects of business decisions over time.

Questions and Answers:
Q: What happens if the discounts are reduced by 20%?

A: By reducing the discounts given to customers by 20%, we simulate an increase in revenue, as the company will no longer be offering the same level of financial concessions. However, we also analyze if this impacts the overall customer satisfaction and order frequency. This scenario helps evaluate the balance between profitability and customer retention.

Q: What is the impact of increasing delivery fees by ₹20 per order?

A: By simulating a ₹20 increase in the delivery fee per order, we calculate how this adjustment affects the business's profitability. While increasing delivery fees generally boosts the business's revenue per order, it may also impact customer satisfaction and order volume. This analysis helps understand whether the increase compensates for the potential decrease in demand.

Q: What is the breakeven commission increase?

A: The breakeven commission increase is the optimal increase in the commission fee where the business achieves the maximum possible profit without adversely affecting the overall demand or customer satisfaction. This analysis allows us to find the sweet spot for commission rates, ensuring profitability while retaining competitive pricing.

Q: How does profit vary across different payment methods and restaurant IDs?

A: Segment-wise profit analysis by payment method and restaurant ID allows us to identify which payment methods or specific restaurants are more profitable. This helps in recognizing trends, such as which payment methods result in higher transaction fees or which restaurants have better-performing revenue models.

Q: Did profits increase or decrease on a month-over-month basis?

A: Time-based analysis helps identify the trend in profits from one month to another. By analyzing this data, we can observe whether certain months are more profitable (perhaps due to seasonal demand) or if there are any decreasing trends due to business strategies, market conditions, or other factors.

Impact:
This project helps in making data-driven decisions regarding pricing, commission structures, and customer incentives. By experimenting with different scenarios, businesses can optimize their revenue model and adjust their strategies to ensure long-term profitability.
